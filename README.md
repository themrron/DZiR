# CashKaro Top Stores Page - Static Clone

This is a simplified static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript clone of the visual layout for a "Top Cashback Stores" page, inspired by CashKaro.com.

## Features (Static Demo)

*   Basic responsive layout for header, main content area, and footer.
*   Grid display for store cards.
*   Store cards showing:
    *   Placeholder Logo
    *   Store Name
    *   Cashback Information
    *   Offer Details
    *   "Activate Cashback" button (non-functional, just logs to console).
*   Basic JavaScript to dynamically render store items from a predefined array.
*   Simple client-side category filtering.

## Files

*   `index.html`: The main HTML structure of the page.
*   `style.css`: Contains all the CSS rules for styling the page.
*   `script.js`: JavaScript for dynamic content loading (store cards) and basic filtering.

## How to Run Locally

1.  Clone this repository or download the files.
2.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## How to View on GitHub Pages

If this repository is hosted on GitHub, GitHub Pages can be used to deploy it live:

1.  Go to the repository's **Settings** tab.
2.  In the left sidebar, click on **Pages**.
3.  Under "Build and deployment", for the **Source**, select **Deploy from a branch**.
4.  Choose the `main` (or `master`) branch and the `/(root)` folder.
5.  Click **Save**.
6.  GitHub will build and deploy your site. The URL will be something like `https://your-username.github.io/your-repository-name/`.

## Limitations

This is **NOT** a functional cashback website. It's a frontend-only visual demonstration and lacks:
*   A backend server.
*   A database.
*   User authentication.
*   Real affiliate integrations or link tracking.
*   Cashback calculation or payout mechanisms.
*   Connection to any actual store data or APIs.

This project serves as a basic example of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for page layout.
